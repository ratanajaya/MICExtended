### Disclaimer
This  application is a fork of yogee's <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icompress/">Mass Image Compressor app</a>, utilizing its compression methods while entirely redoing the UI and modifying some behaviors to suit my personal preference. Eventually this application will have more features before being released for public.

#### Tech & Design Pattern
.Net 6, WinForm, Dependency Injection, MVVM, Unit Testing.
