# Mass Image Compressor Extended

> Windows application for compressing image in a batch

### Disclaimer
This  application is a fork of yogee's <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icompress/">Mass Image Compressor app</a>, utilizing it's compression methods while entirely redoing the UI and modifying some behaviors to suit my personal preference. Eventually this application will have more features before being released for public.
